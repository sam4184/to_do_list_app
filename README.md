# To Do List App

This is a simple to do app made with Django. The person can add tasks, and every new task is displayed in red color, and the status is set to 'To do'. The user can then click the task to turn it into green, meaning the current status of the task is now 'doing'. Finally, from 'doing', the status of the task can turn into 'completed' and the task is displayed with a strikethrough.

On the other hand, the other buttons displayed on the screen do exactly what their name suggests.
